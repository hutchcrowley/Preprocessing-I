          <p>Dear Sir or Madam:,</p>

          <p>
            My name is Hutch Crowley, and I am a graduate of MTSU. I received a
            bachelor of science with a major in Recording Industry Management,
            Production Technology concentration. I received a minor in Computer
            Information Systems. I also have experience with customer service
            and sales. I am a fast learner with a meticulous eye for detail, as
            well as being a team-oriented person with an outgoing personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to interview for this job or internship personally with
            you. Please let me know if you are interested, and if so, when we
            could meet. My cell number in the header is the best way to get in
            contact with me. Alternatively, an e-mail works just as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also like to thank you again for considering me for this
            opportunity, and I hope that we will be able to work together in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>James Crowley</p>
